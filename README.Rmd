# nzdata

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

nzdata is an API wrapper for data.govt.nz

## Installation

You can install the development version of nzdata from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("courtneyruss/nzdata")
```

## Example

This example requests data from dataset ["A-Z listing of all Whanganui streets"](https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/whanganui-streets-a-z/resource/2f4e30a7-091f-4aed-b18f-4b21cc19e6b4)

```{r example}
library(nzdata)
streets <- load_data('2f4e30a7-091f-4aed-b18f-4b21cc19e6b4')
streets$result

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
